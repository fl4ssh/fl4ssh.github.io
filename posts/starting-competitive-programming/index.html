People can participate competition alone or in a team. Example of a competitive programming challenge:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:
 - answer[i] == &#34;FizzBuzz&#34; if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
 - answer[i] == &#34;Fizz&#34; if i is divisible by 3.
 - answer[i] == &#34;Buzz&#34; if i is divisible by 5.
 - answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.
</code></pre><p>That is very simple and beginner level task that requires a knowledge of <code>if, else if, else</code> conditional statements.</p><h1 id=why-should-someone-consider-competitive-programming>Why should someone consider competitive programming?<a href=#why-should-someone-consider-competitive-programming class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h1><p>For the programming beginners it is a good start to learn a programming language. At the start, it could get very boring to cram theory of a language. It would be more effective to practice and apply obtained knowledge by solving some tasks.</p><p>For the people with some experience in coding, they will benefit from finding a solution that runs quicker and consumes less memory. Moreover, they can always compare their solution with others. That way they will also obtain code review skills that are essential for good programmers.</p><p>Another reason to start competitive programming is that it helps to prepare a developer for the technical interviews. FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) and other big tech companies expects their candidates to be good at solving the coding tasks. Althought solving a challenge is not the only criteria that they consider, but it is definitely part of the hiring decision.</p><p>Finally, it is just fun thing to do. You can find good friends and teammates by communicating, learning and sharing your ideas with others.</p><h1 id=how-should-someone-start-their-journey>How should someone start their journey?<a href=#how-should-someone-start-their-journey class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h1><p>There are many different options to start, but my favourites are:</p><ul><li><a href=https://interviews.school>Interviews school</a>: top-1 website to start from the basics of data structures (DS) and algorithms. It is totally FREE!</li><li><a href=https://algoexpert.io>Algoexpert</a>: platform that has different types of challenges grouped by topics. Each challenge has a solution and video with explanation. The prices vary from $39 to $81 dollars per year. I think that is a good investment that you can make.</li><li><a href=https://codewars.com>Codewars</a>: another free-of-charge website to start. They took the approach of east martial arts. It makes the learning interesting.</li><li><a href=https://leetcode.com>Leetcode</a>: the best platform that has the largest amount of coding tasks. There are learning materials, video solutions, community that shares their solutions / comments / ideas. And it is free.</li></ul></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button next"><a href=https://fl4ssh.github.io/posts/hello-world/><span class=button__text>Hello World</span>
